        <strong>Project Intern</strong><br>
        May 2023 - Jun 2023 Â· 2 mos<br>
        This project involves automating email reading by using the IMAP protocol and creating a response to
        the query asked in the email with the help of Bing Chat API and OpenAI ChatGPT API and sending
        that response as a reply mail back to that sender by using the SMTP protocol. I have used various libraries
        and methods to get this work done. Prepared an XML file that contains all the relevant details like
        IMAP server and port, email details, etc., which are then retrieved by the python script.

        <strong>Mini-Project done in my 2nd Semester:</strong><br>
        <strong>Name:</strong> Integrating a Heartbeat Sensor with a Piezoelectric Buzzer<br>
        <strong>Duration:</strong> February 2022 - April 2022<br>
        <strong>Summary:</strong> This project was carried out to enhance the experience of blind
        people using a heartbeat sensor to monitor their pulse without having to look at the serial monitor
        while connected to an Arduino board. To tackle this, we decided to integrate a piezoelectric sensor
        that would buzz a specific number of times based on the pulse that was sensed by the heartbeat sensor.
